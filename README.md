# faerun

Tools for D&D (5th Edition, 2024 Version) in Dart (and Flutter).

Faerun is a standalone Dart package that provides schema definitions and
utilities for working with the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset (using
the 2024 version of the rules where possible). This package is intended to be
used in conjunction with other Dart packages that provide more specific
functionality, such as character generators, spell databases, or encounter
builders.
